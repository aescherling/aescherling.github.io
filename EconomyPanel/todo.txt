Buggy variables:
- educational attainment, high school, male/female
- taxable sales receipts

- fix table sort when there are ties
- mouseover table => highlight district on map?

- Create a more clean/robust variable selection system
- recode the "updateMap" function so it's a little less ugly

- why doesn't unemployment rate round to 2 decimals? any other variables?

- Make the whole thing robust to screen size changes

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time

Variables to be adjusted:
- population (adjust for area (i.e. square miles) of council district)
- educational attainment by gender (calculate as % of population, otherwise adjust for area)
