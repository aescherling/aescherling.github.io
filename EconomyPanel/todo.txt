- fix time toggle so clicking on a district won't do anything until a variable is selected
- Disable time toggle when a relevant field is still blank
- Format the values
- Add graph title (e.g. "Average Commuting Time, minutes")
- Plot density where appropriate
- Add a data table on the right hand side
- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset
- remove the cf variable which was used for debugging

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time
