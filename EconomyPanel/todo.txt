- switching between variables in the same category no longer works...

Buggy variables:
- educational attainment, high school, male/female
- taxable sales receipts
- selecting gender before subindicator

- mouseover changes the table text style

- make mouseover change the time toggle to a sparkline time series chart


- Create a more clean/robust variable selection system
- make sure code is well-labeled and readable


- click "location" and "value" to change the ordering


Variables to be adjusted:
- population (adjust for area (i.e. square miles) of council district)
- educational attainment by gender (calculate as % of population, otherwise adjust for area)

- Check: is the whole thing robust to screen size changes?

- put together instructions for Beacon as to formatting the data
- put together instructions for the city controller's office for updating the data
