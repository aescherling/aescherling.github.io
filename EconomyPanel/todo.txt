- Create a more robust filtering system. Allow subindicator to change without changing gender?
- fix time toggle so clicking on a district won't do anything until a variable is selected
- Disable time toggle when a relevant field is still blank

- Plot density where appropriate

- Add a data table on the right hand side?
- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset
- remove the cf variable which was used for debugging

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time
