** very necessary things **
---------------------------
- figure out why it's not compatible with IE and give user some sort of warning
- sometimes the districts change color when a category is selected for the first time... why??
- put together instructions for Beacon as to formatting the data
  - have them reformat "educational attainment" so that it doesn't include gendered values
- put together instructions for the city controller's office for updating the data


** other improvements and fixes **
----------------------------------
- Create a more clean/robust variable selection system
- make sure code is well-labeled and readable
- Variables to be adjusted:
  - population (adjust for area (i.e. square miles) of council district)
  - educational attainment by gender (calculate as % of population, otherwise adjust for area)
- Check: is the whole thing robust to screen size changes?


** things that might be cool **
-------------------------------
- make mouseover change the time toggle to a sparkline time series chart
- click "location" and "value" to change the ordering
