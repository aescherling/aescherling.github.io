- Create a more clean/robust filtering system
- recode the "updateMap" function so it's a little less ugly
- Plot density where appropriate
- Add a data table on the right hand side?
- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset
- remove the cf variable which was used for debugging

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time
