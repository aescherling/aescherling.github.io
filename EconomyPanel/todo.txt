Buggy variables:
- educational attainment, high school, male/female
- taxable sales receipts

- sync data table with variable selection so it's blank if a variable isn't chosen
- sync data table so a row is highlighted if the district is selected on the map (click or mouseover)

- Create a more clean/robust variable selection system
- recode the "updateMap" function so it's a little less ugly

- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset (or remove entirely?)
- remove the cf variable which was used for debugging

- Make the whole thing robust to screen size changes

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time

Variables to be adjusted:
- population (adjust for area (i.e. square miles) of council district)
- educational attainment by gender (calculate as % of population, otherwise adjust for area)
