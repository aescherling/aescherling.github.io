- Add graph title (e.g. "Average Commuting Time, minutes")
- Change data categories
- Plot density where appropriate
- Add a data table on the right hand side
- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Improve formatting for selected council districts (change opacity of unselected districts)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset


For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time
