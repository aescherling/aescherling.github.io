- Create a more robust filtering system. Allow subindicator to change without changing gender?
  - when indicator is selected, set a "hasGender" boolean for changing selection behavior

- figure out what's wrong with educational attainment variables (by gender, and picking "" for the gender of the one that is supposedly not by gender)
- population by age by gender also messed up
- also population by income and gender, population by race and gender
- also employment by occupation and gender

- recode the "updateMap" function so it's a little less ugly

- Plot density where appropriate

- Add a data table on the right hand side?
- Consider having an option to break up the map and turn it into a 4x4 grid (a la d3-exploder)
- Attach sparklines to the dataset
- remove the cf variable which was used for debugging

For speeding it up:
- make sure there are no more than 8 filters defined at any time
