- make mouseover change the time toggle to a sparkline time series chart
- disable mouseover and click for table when the table isn't visible

- add an option to disable the menu toggling

- Create a more clean/robust variable selection system

- click "location" and "value" to change the ordering
- create a gray rect underneath a row when it is highlighted (or make one visible)

Buggy variables:
- educational attainment, high school, male/female
- taxable sales receipts
- selecting gender before subindicator

- why doesn't unemployment rate round to 2 decimals? any other variables? also housing vacancy rate. make sure Math.round() is being called on a number and not a string

Variables to be adjusted:
- population (adjust for area (i.e. square miles) of council district)
- educational attainment by gender (calculate as % of population, otherwise adjust for area)

- Check: is the whole thing robust to screen size changes?

- put together instructions for Beacon as to formatting the data
- put together instructions for the city controller's office for updating the data
