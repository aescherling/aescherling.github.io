Aging,1,"""This Department plans, contracts, and directly administers programs for older adults residing in the City of Los Angeles and their family caregivers through a network of 16 multi-purpose senior centers and Citywide service providers. These programs include both congregate and home-delivered nutrition services, disease prevention, legal services, health promotion, social services, and transportation assistance. The programs promote healthy living, physical activity, and mental and emotional wellness for older adults. They are designed to promote an interdependent, comprehensive, accessible, culturally sensitive, and socially inclusive system of programs for older adults and caregivers. These programs are funded by federal Older Americans Act and state Older Californians Act grant funds.
